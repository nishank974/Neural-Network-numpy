Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns.
They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input.


The above code is complete implementation of Neural Networks which can be expanded to many hidden layers.
I added a notebook to give an example with the MNIST data.
